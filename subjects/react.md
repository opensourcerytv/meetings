React is a library for building dynamic data-driven user interfaces in a declarative, component-centric way. It's fast, powerful, and quicker to develop with.

Learn React from zero to hero (or at least, faithful sidekick). What it is. How it works. Why you'd use it. We'll cover everything you need to start from absolute scratch, to building your own complex interfaces from components you've made yourself. 

Along the way we'll cover the basics of styling, performance, application architecture, extensibility, and accessibility. You'll learn to how to understand existing components, debug your own, recognize and avoid common bug-vectors, and "think in React". 

You'll walk away with the skills and knowledge to build your own small projects and work with a team on a React project.
